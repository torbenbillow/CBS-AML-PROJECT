This is the repository for our Applied Machine Learning group project at CBS.

## ✅ Quick Start (after you’ve accepted the invite)

1. Open the repo: https://github.com/torbenbillow/CBS-AML-PROJECT
2. Open our starter notebook in Colab:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](
https://colab.research.google.com/github/torbenbillow/CBS-AML-PROJECT/blob/main/notebooks/00_welcome.ipynb)

> [For your first time in Colab with our private repo] You must navigate to http://colab.research.google.com/github and allow access to **private repositories**.

3. Work in Colab. Run cells (Shift+Enter), make edits.
4. Save back to GitHub: **File → Save. 
   - **Repository:** `torbenbillow/CBS-AML-PROJECT`
   - **Branch:** create one, e.g. `feature/<your-name>-eda`
   - **Path:** keep notebooks under `notebooks/`
   - **Commit message:** short description of your changes
5. Open a Pull Request and request a review. We merge into `main` via PRs only.

## 🧭 Team Workflow (Colab + GitHub)

- **Open from badge** so you’re on the latest version.
- **One branch per task/person** (e.g., `feature/torben-cleaning`).
- **Small, frequent commits**; then open a **PR** for feedback/merge.
- Optional: before saving to GitHub, **Edit → Clear all outputs** in Colab to keep diffs small.


## 📂 Project Structure
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for experiments and analysis.
